# Getting Started

This 'repository' is to get you initiated into the codemonkeys, that is, to get you started coding with python using github

##So what is GitHub and what is Python?

###GitHub
is first and foremost a *repository*, that is, a place where software and other related files can be stored. But more than that, GitHub will allow the Aurora CodeMonkeys to share their stuff and work collaboratively. That why we like it :)

The other thing we like about GitHub are that they can be used for any coding language, so if, after the intorductory exercises you decide to branch out to a different language, you can stay with us *in the club*.

###Python
is a programming language, and one that is very underestimated. Some people describe it as a 'learning language' but it is so much more than that. It can be used to develop very sophisticated applications from everything from windoze desktops to android phones (not really sure about ipads and iphones but then again...who really cares)

##I don't really have any idea what you are talking about but I'd like to join anyway
OK, no worries lets set this puppy up!

This guide assumes you are working on an Aurora device with a 64bit operating system. If this is not the case, get in contact with Dr G and he will help you sort things out.

***A long process this is, patience you must have my young codemonkey...***

- ###install python
at the time of writing the [current version of python is python 3.5] (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.0/python-3.5.0-amd64.exe)

- ###install git
So git is the program that allows you to 'push' and 'pull' files between the GitHub repository (see above). At the time of writing this guide, [2.5.3 is the latest version](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.5.3.windows.1/Git-2.5.3-64-bit.exe).

- ###install pygame
This is a collection of modules we can use to develop if you go to the pygame website you wont find a version thats compatible with python 3.5 64bit. But *DON'T PANIC*, you can download a [suitable version here](https://schoolsnsw-my.sharepoint.com/personal/geoff_goldrick_det_nsw_edu_au/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=uWYZg3Q9RnS46ukiubMD1348gIr9lRG3zA9%2bi9jMJaA%3d&docid=088367932673949709f0f8ed72333bd06).

- ###install pycharm
PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE), that is, some thing that helps you write and run code with a lot of nice features that make life easy. We are going to use the [PyCharm Education version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/download/download_thanks.jsp?os=win).

- ###set up pycharm
Start PyCharm. At the PyCharm Welcome screen choose *Configure* then *Settings*
![PyCharm start-up screen](https://schoolsnsw-my.sharepoint.com/personal/geoff_goldrick_det_nsw_edu_au/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=WYE7XVvXp%2fpoP1wWC8V9W%2ftRNWZArog5Vhd6r26X3zk%3d&docid=0daf1fc33e7da4408aca4165ce923c6e9)

Under *Version Control* choose GitHub and enter you account details.

Now go back to the Welcome screen and choose Check out from version control
